# 821. Shortest Distance to a Character

## Description

Given a string **S** and a character **C**, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character **C** in the string.

## Solution

### Note

* Simulating a stack to store the character between two **C** in **S**

* Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$, $n$ is the length of **S**

* Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$, $n$ is the length of **S**

### Implementation

```cpp
vector<int> shortestToChar(string S, char C) {
    vector<int> result;
    vector<int> temp;
    // position difference between the current character and previous C
    // -1 denotes no C so far
    int diff = -1;
    for (char c : S) {
        if (c == C) {
            // find C, determine the characters before this C
            for (int i = 0; i < temp.size(); i++) {
                result.push_back(min(temp[i], (int) temp.size() - i));
            }
            result.push_back(0);
            // reset for diff and temp
            diff = 1;
            temp.clear();
        } else {
            temp.push(diff == -1 ? INT_MAX : diff++);
        }
    }
    // deal with substring with no C before the end of S
    for (int i = 0; i < temp.size(); i++) {
        result.push_back(temp[i]);
    }
    return result;
}
```
