# 322. Coin Change

## Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

## Solution

### Note

* Complete Knapsack - Normal Order

* Dynamic Porgramming: dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coins[i]] + 1)

* Time Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$, $n$ is the number of coins

* Space Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$, $n$ is the number of coins

### Implementation

```cpp
int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
    int MAX = amount + 1;
    vector<int> dp(amount + 1, MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) {
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - coins[i]] + 1);
        }
    }
    return (dp[amount] == MAX) ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```
